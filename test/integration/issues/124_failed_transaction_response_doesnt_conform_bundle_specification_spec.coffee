  Issue #124
  Failed transaction response doesn't conform Bundle specification
  <https://github.com/fhirbase/fhirbase-plv8/issues/124>

  Hi!

  Issue connected with #119, but my case is related to errors during transaction:

  Trying to create resource of non-existing type:

  ```
  fhirbase=# SELECT fhir_transaction('{"resourceType":"Bundle","type":"transaction","entry":[{"resource":{"resourceType":"UnknownResource","active":true,"name":[{"use":"official","family":["Snow"],"given":["John"]}],"gender":"male","birthDate":"2001-01-01"},"request":{"method":"POST","url":"UnknownResource"}}]}');
  ```
  a response
  ```
  fhir_transaction | {"resourceType":"Bundle","type":"transaction-response","entry":[{"resourceType":"OperationOutcome","text":{"div":"<div>Storage for UnknownResource does not exist</div>"},"issue":[{"severity":"error","code":"not-supported"}]}]}
  ```

  The response doesn't conform specification at: https://www.hl7.org/fhir/bundle-response.json.html

  Tested on v.1.3.0.15
